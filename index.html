                            "The best way to summarize my feelings is to say “I didn’t know what I didn’t know”. The basic drills we performed were essential in learning certain strokes, but the best part were your teachings on strategy. I can now visualize where to be on the court, and when to be there. My game has really improved. Thanks Prem."</p>

                        <p>"All I can say is WOW!!! After just three days of working with Prem, my approach to the game has completely changed. Prem broke it down in a way that was easy to understand and relate to. He was able to point out my mistakes within minutes and helped me correct them even faster. He gave helpful tips for drilling and really helped me “play smarter” pickleball. All I know is, the next time Prem comes to my neck of the woods I will be the first one to sign up!”</p>

                        <p>"What I like about Prem is that he gives you a chance to come to your own realization that the changes he’s suggesting are good. He believes in what he’s saying, but he doesn’t pressure you to do it his way…"</p>

                        <p>"I am 60 years young and disabled, from a spinal cord surgery. I picked up pickleball, about a year and half ago, thinking this might help me get back. I can do some shots well, but can not move, so I get caught in wrong position. I was taught well by a local ambassador, and very proud of what he has done for my game. I have read and listen to Prem’s book so I took his 2 day clinic. ... What Prem showed me, were the little things that I was not seeing or believing I could do. Am I fixed after 2 days? Heck no, but what I got was be smarter than the guy that over hits his serve, or tries that put away shot off a good dink, into net. So want to thank you, Prem, for what you showed me in a very short time... You "sharpened my saw"... What I mean is I was the guy who was in such a hurry he never sharpened his saw to cut down the trees, so it took forever to cut down that tree and it still was not happening. Now my saw is sharpened, and with hard work, I will be able to play a better game, thank you again!"</p>

                        <p>"My wife I were very excited about taking your seminar. We had recently watched your webinar and learned some really good pointers and we hoped that doing your clinic would elevate our games. We loved it! You really brought up some things we never would have thought about on our own. We are putting our new knowledge to the test every game. Cant wait to get more playing time. We would tell anyone considering doing your clinic DO IT ! Thanks so much.</p>
