            If you take 10 of the top pickleball players in the country,
            you’ll see that they each have different styles, techniques
            and form, depending on their racket sport background (or
            lack thereof).<br>
            Prem could teach you how HE hits the ball, but he has
            spent hundreds of hours practicing pickleball, table tennis,
            cricket and other sports at the national level, so there is no
            way you could have the exact same shot that HE does. Nor
            should you!<br>
            At The Pickleball Guru Academy, I look at YOUR game. I assess and analyze YOUR
            strengths, limitations, athletic ability, background and help YOU play Smart Pickleball.</p>
